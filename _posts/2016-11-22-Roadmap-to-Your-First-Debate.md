## 1. Know all the cases you may face! 

There's no point in preparing an argument if you can't run it or your opponent won't ever say anything that relates to it. The Washington State Forensics League (WSFL) has a couple rules for novices. 

There are four affirmatives which are allowed:

- **Space** - the USFG should substantially increase its space cooperation
  with the People’s Republic of China, including repealing the Wolf Amendment. 
- **Taiwan** - the USFG should negotiate a grand bargain with the People’s
  Republic of China by offering to end its commitment to defend Taiwan in exchange for China’s peaceful resolution to territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. 
- **Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)** - the USFG should offer a sectoral bilateral investment treaty with the People’s Republic of China. 
- **Renewable Energy** - the USFG should  should substantially increase its renewable energy cooperation with the People’s Republic of China. 


Negatives are also quite restrictive: 

- All disadvantages are allowed
- Only capitalism kritik is allowed
- No counterplans

## 2. Read Up On the Case and Get Yourself Some Background Info

There's a lot of information, however in general an informed debater is a better debater. Even if you haven't prepared against an argument your opponent runs, if you can make good logical arguments in return, you still have a chance. You have a higher chance of success with this if you are knowledgeable about the topic. 

#### What you should do:

Spend an hour looking up the state of China right now, and research the affirmative cases you are allowed to run. This means going on OpenEv and figuring out what plans people are using and then learning some background info.

## 3. Know the debate terms, and the framework on which most debates operate on. 

Here are the basic terms that you'll need to know: 

![Basics of Debate](http://i.imgur.com/KaIjm6G.png)



Policy debate is focused around a policy maker's viewpoint, whether in that policy maker's opinion, we need to pass the resolution. A plan is presented by the affirmative which supports the resolution and gives the judge reasons to support it, and the negative presents reasons why we shouldn't go along with the affirmative's plan. 

#### Affirmative - I affirm the resolution. 

The affirmative has to make the judge say "Yes!" to the resolution. This means that they have to come up with a plan that meets the resolution, and make the judge understand why we need to say yes to the plan. They have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that *we need the plan, otherwise bad things™ will happen.*

**Burden of Proof:** the obligation of the affirmative to present a case supporting the resolution

With the plan that the affirmative makes comes the **Stock issues**, which are a set of issues regarding why we should talk about the resolution now. They are: 

1. **Topicality:** the plan that the affirmative is proposing is on the topic of the resolution. If the affirmative argues about hamburgers when the resolution is whether we should back out of the Paris Climate Treaty, then you are non-topical. The opposing side will always win if they can prove you are non-topical, because how are they supposed to fairly debate when the topic they spent time preparing for isn't the topic that is being discussed? 
2. **Inherency**: the plan that the affirmative is proposing will solve something which won't be solved in the status quo. There must be an *inherent barrier* preventing the plan that the affirmative is proposing to be implemented. 
3. **Solvency:**does it solve the problem
4. **Harms:** The benefit of implementing the plan. what happens if we don't solve? 
5. **Significance**: why we should care about this now. Why is this an issue that has to be solved now, versus later in the future

***IF THE NEGATIVE CAN PROVE THAT ANY ONE OF THESE ARE MISSING, THEN YOU LOSE THE DEBATE. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ADDRESS THESE.***

The stock issues are generally laid throughout the case, and they are accompanied by **advantages**, which are reasons why to chose the plan. 

Advantages are laid out in the following order: 

1. Statement of advantage - Tell people beforehand what the advantage is
2. Internal links to Impact - Your reasoning that leads you to the impact
3. Impact - The effect your plan causes. Eg. prevents nuclear war.

You will usually have multiple advantages for your plan to build an effective case.

**Collectively the stock issues and also advantages are known as on-case.** 

#### Negative - the plan the affirmative is proposing will cause great harm

The negative has the **Burden of Rejoinder**, which means they have to clash with the affirmative. It is the negative's duty to bring up reasons why the affirmative's plan is a bad idea. 

They have several means of doing so: 

- **Disadvantages** - The plan is poorly thought out and will lead to problems later on
- **Counterplans** - The plan leads to some major problems down the road. A counterplan is offered and will lead to a net benefit
- **Kritiks** - The plan encounters some moral/philosophical issues which, again, lead to some major implications down the road. A mini-counterplan is offered up which doesn't run into the moral/philosophical issue.

**These are all known as off-case.** 

They can also bring up the stock issues, and explain why the affirmative doesn't meet them. 

##### Disadvantage 

Disadvantages are the bread and butter of the negative, and as such are the most common. There are four parts to a disadvantage: 

- Uniqueness - under the current status quo, the disadvantage will not occur. However, the plan will cause the harm. 
- Link - How the plan leads to the harm
- Brink - Why we are on the brink of the harm
- Impact - the harm which will occur as a result of the plan occurring, and how it will affect the population

##### Counterplan

Counterplans are also quite common, although not as common as disadvantages. It will be very common this year as the 

##### What this means:

You have a lot of arguments to prepare... good thing OpenEV exists! Expect to spend an hour or two every day cutting cards, practicing spreading, flowing, and in general getting 'in shape' for the debate so you can be successful.
